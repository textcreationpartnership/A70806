            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am commanded to preſent to your Lordſhips theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, with which the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Commons houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in their own name, and in the name of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach Sir <hi>Robert Barkley,</hi> Knight, one of the Juſtices of his Majeſties Court of Kings bench in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their accuſation of high Treaſon, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great miſdemeanours. The Articles they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be read.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Articles were read by Mr.</hi> Newport.</p>
            <p>The high Treaſon is in the firſt Article, in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſubvert the fundamentall Laws of this Realm, and to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call government, which have been lately adjudged Treaſon, in the cauſe of the Earle of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Articles prove the firſt. By his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Certificates, Judgements, by his denials of the benefits of our Laws, which have been read to your Lordſhips. No fundamentall Law to the Subject is left, our goods, our lands, our bodies, the peace of a good conſcience are by him given up to Arbitrary, Tyrannicall Government.</p>
            <p>Nothing hath been omitted to make a Judge know the Laws, to make him juſt, or fear him from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61946:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 67 -->being evil; We have Innes of Court for that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtudy, Judges from thence onely choſen; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome any but what have been twenty years there; Honours and revenues are given to Judges, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to do well; this Judge had theſe; Judges are ſworn according to Law to ſerve the King, and his people, according to Law to counſell the King, and for not ſo doing, to be at his will for body, lands and goods; this Judge took that oath; the Laws the Judges ſtudy, impoſe the greateſt puniſhments on unjuſt Judges, ſhew that theſe puniſhments have been inflicted; more could not be done to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade or fear a Judge.</p>
            <p>His offences ſhew in him great ambition, yet he was moſt timorous of diſpleaſing the great in power he did not onely forbear doing what he was ſworn to do, but was moſt active againſt our Lawes, &amp; in oppoſing and puniſhing any that did maintein them.</p>
            <p>To have only received Bribes (though they blind the eyes, and though the deſire to get money en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth with age) that hainous crime in a Judge had been, in compariſon with his offences, a tolerable vice; for from ſuch a Judge juſtice is alſo to be had for money. Ambition is violent, and ruines, whilſt Covetouſneſſe is making a bargain.</p>
            <p>The words of his opinions and judgement are for the Kings power. It is pleaſing to the nature of man that others ſhould obey his will; and well fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med diſpoſitions of Princes may eaſily be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their power is unlimited, when they are alſo put in mind, that therefore they have more cauſe to do well, and for doing well are more renowned; For the moſt oppreſſive deſignes (which we have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61946:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 67 -->under) the pretences to his Majeſtie have ever been the good of his Subjects; His is the ſin, that is to judge by the Lawes, and knows the Lawes are to the contrary, yet puts and confirms ſuch thoughts in his Prince.</p>
            <p>He that incites another to Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when his ſelf-ends are thereby compaſſed, hates him for taking that power he perſwaded him unto.</p>
            <p>The writs, thoſe monſters of neceſſitie to provide Ships to prevent imminent danger that could not ſtay forty daies for the calling of a Parliament, were therefore to goe out in <hi>September</hi> to have Ships rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in <hi>March.</hi> This hath been adjudged by your Lordſhips to bee deſtructive to the fundamentall lawes of this Realm and to the ſubiect right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and liberty &amp;c. that I ſhall ſay but this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, that this Judge publiſhed them to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable flowers of the Crown. And that wee have lived to ſee for five yeares together imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thus to bee prevented.</p>
            <p>This Judge did adviſe to ſuch a government as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Kings here might exerciſe the higheſt Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Subjects want the benefit of reſtraints known to the moſt ſlaviſh Eaſterne nations where if their Prince doth unjuſtly, he hath hatred for it, and the dangers that follow that. This Judge will have that hatred to goe to our good lawes. No ſuch bondage as when lawes of freedom are miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Judges to make men ſlaves.</p>
            <p>What can be conſidered of in a Judge of Law to give his opinion and adviſe to his Prince how the lawes the mutuall covenants of Kings and Subjects
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61946:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 68 -->are to be broken but that his intentions are to have his Prince doe ill by making his evill ſervants to ſtudy, and to be pleaſed with their wicked deſignes: becauſe they ſee means to put them in execution, by making them to perſwade their Prince, becauſe in imminent danger, his Subjects goods are at his will, that there is ſuch danger when there is not: and they onely have ſome by-end of their own.</p>
            <p>A Judge to deliver his opinion, that if the King ſhould intend to give up his people to be deſtroyed by forreign forces, for the ſafety of the people in that imminent danger once by the Law might take away the King; there could be no greater offence.</p>
            <p>This Judge will have our Law to be what to him ſeems reaſon; the reaſon limited to him to judge of is what the common Law ſaith is ſo, what a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute hath ſo enacted. For him to judge this or that is Law, elſe a miſchief ſhall follow, is at beſt for him, but this becauſe the Law in ſuch a thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, therefore he will make a Law to ſupply it; or becauſe that the Law written in ſuch particulars is againſt his reaſon, therefore his reaſons to be Laws; then muſt follow, as often as a Judges reaſon changes, or Judges change, our Laws change alſo.</p>
            <p>Our liberties are in our Laws, where a Subject may reade or hear read, this is his, this he may do, and be ſafe, and that thus the Judge ought to give judgement, he is free. The exceſſive growth of Courts of reaſon, conſcience, came from great and cunning perſons, and though not the moſt ſodain, yet the moſt dangerous, and ſure wayes to eat out our Laws, our liberties.</p>
            <p>Unlimited power muſt be in ſome to make and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61946:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 68 -->repeal Laws to fit the diſpoſitions of times and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Nature placeth this in common conſent only, and where all cannot conveniently meet, inſtructeth them to give their conſents to ſome they know or believe ſo well of as to be bound to what they agree on. His Majeſtie, your Lordſhips and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are thus met in Parliament, and ſo long as we are often reduced to this main foundation, our King and we ſhall proſper.</p>
            <p>This Judge will not allow us our knowledge or any reaſon, he will have our minds, our ſouls ſlaves. A grand Jury-man gave his fellows true informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they preſent an innovation in the Church, are threatned &amp; reviled for it; he that told this truth is charged (I ſhall uſe this Judges own words) to ſin in that, &amp; that he made others forſwear themſelvs; this Judge ſent him to the common goal, where he is laid in irons, and all this, becauſe he and they durſt meddle with Church-matters. He is forced to tear the Preſentment in pieces in open Court; our Laws provide for the peace of our conſciences, many Acts of Parliament are for it, and the truſt by thoſe Acts ſet to Juries; this Judge well knew all this; your Lordſhips have heard what he did to the Jury at <hi>Hartford;</hi> He would have us know no more Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then to obey what the Great of the Clergy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, no more Law then what he ſaid was ſo.</p>
            <p>Judges in former times, (but onely ſuch as were examples of puniſhment, as of injuſtice in caſes of great and publike concernment) forbare procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings till the next Parliament. This neceſſitated the calling of Parliaments; this Judge had as many ſuch cauſes before him, as ever any had, yet he never
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61946:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 69 -->deſired the reſolution of Parliament in any one, for the wayes he went, the neceſſitie was never to have a Parliament, he would pull up that root of our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and liberties, which whilſt we enioy, the malice or injuſtice of all other Courts and perſons can never ruine, and when neere to ruin (as moſt neere of late) this onely ſure remedy will helpe us, nothing can ruine a Parliament, but it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The evills which we have ſuffred under, they were committed by the Iudges, or by them ought to have been and might have bene prevented.</p>
            <p>This Judge aſſiſted in cauſing the miſeries we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred in the Starchamber and at the councell table, he denied the known rights which he ought to have granted us to ſtop our grievances in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Courts, he was the cauſer of our ſufferings in other Courts.</p>
            <p>The beſt lovers of their Laws and liberties, the moſt honeſt ſuffer moſt by an unjuſt Judge, they moſt oppoſe his vices; diſhoneſt perſons find ſuch a Judge to fit their purpoſes, the Judge finds them for his, the bond of iniquity confederates them.</p>
            <p>He that will do no wrong, will ſuffer none which he can help: the man that knows himſelf born free, will do his utmoſt to live ſo, and to leave freedome to his poſterity, were he in ſlavery, when by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſture thought to be moſt delighted, were his mind then known, there would be found vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his buſie thoughts imployed to redeem himſelf and his poſterity from thraldome. But to ſay, could this Judge intend to make himſelf and his own poſterity Slaves? What he did was through errour of judgement onely; No my Lords, what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61946:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 69 -->his aimes and endeavours were is apparent. To conſider man in the generall, we ſhall find in every age he will be a ſlave to ſome few, that many may be ſlaves to him, he looks to himſelf onely; this he would doe or forbear doing to be great, to be rich, had he children or kindred or had none. This high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unjuſt Judge by continuing ſinnes, mainteined his actions to preſerve himſelf, he knows to be found guilty in one of his offences, the penaltie of the Law for it, therefore covers the offences committed with inventing and acting other.</p>
            <p>For a Judge to be unjuſt, more hurts the publique then any other, he is not ſuſpected: What a Judge doth is looked on as a thing that ought to be done. The moſt pernitions great man that by cunning hath got to himſelf the heart and tongue of his Prince, his ill acts have dyed with him, if not taken up by others, and then they walke in darkeneſſe, No man will juſtifie what he doth by ſaying ſuch a favorite did it, but the unjuſt Judgments of this Judge were given in the noone day, were done in the face of the whole Kingdome in the hearing of ſuch as might carry the newes to all parts of the Realme, and was therefore done. His unjuſt Judgements were our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. We have ſeen wicked great men moſt crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly politique, they hated our Laws, yet not meeting with active Judges moulded to their purpoſes, they and their acts have dyed, the Realm flouriſhed, but of late others leſſe politique meeting with moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judges, every way as ill as they could wiſh them to be, then did the Kingdome faint under the load of its miſery, did long ſtruggle; now its riſing I aſſure my ſelf, your Lordſhips will aſſiſt to take of the burden.</p>

            <p>If the deſignes of ſome would not have ſuch a man to be at liberty, a warrant from ſome Lords of the Councell would ſoon have laid him in priſon, and given no cauſe; had he moved this Judge to be diſcharged or bailed, he could have obtained nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if their wayes would not have endured that man to live, a Judge reviling the priſoner, and his Councell that moved for his diſcharge or baile, joyned with the hate of ſome great man, might ſoon have moved a Gaoler for unwholſome rooms and lodging, and ill diet for his priſoner, and they may ſoon take life away.</p>
            <p>Offenders in priſons are looked after to be ſafe onely ſuch are brought in by power againſt Law, are abuſed.</p>
            <p>Had a great man deſired the eſtates of others, the breach of a Proclamation might readily have been charged againſt them in the Starchamber: but they, it may be could have anſwered and cleared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and proved their anſwers by teſtimonies, had they been eferred to this Judge, he would have expunged the one, ſuppreſſed the other. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Fines to the value of their eſtates, or more, then impriſonments of courſe till they paid ſuch Fines; your Lordſhips have heard what this Judge did to the Sope-boylers.</p>
            <p>The Country-man followed the plough, and his thinking he was aſſured of his right of Propertie and libertie, gave him abilitie to doe it. He beleeved his neighbour, his landlord, his King, could not take his goods from him without his conſent. He knew the uſuall paiments by law, and in extraordinary cauſes thought to have that care to chooſe ſuch for

               <!-- PDF PAGE 70 -->his Knights of his ſhire, or for his Burgeſſes, as might be mindfull of the cauſe of paiment, and of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>This man hath heard the opinions and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Judge, hath ſeen his goods taken from him without his, or his knights of the Shire, or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes conſent or adviſe. Theſe have made him, his wife, and children to joyne in teares to wiſh they had never been borne, they have made them think on many wayes to keepe ſaſe that eſtate which was yet left them, have made them deſire to ſell all their goods, and hide the money, but then he remembers this Judge, how that he ſhall be carryed to priſon, and remain there if he pay not what pleaſe others to aſſeſſe him. Then they thinke idle perſons (the droanes and moths of the Common wealth) to be a wiſe people, who to be unworthy to live, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conceited. They expect and can think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to be Beggars.</p>
            <p>Where publike and enormous offences have been committed, eminent and notorious puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be, ſuch will make your Lordſhips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings highly eſteemed, elſe there will be ſo many offenders, as none without danger can be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>This Judge, ſubverting our Lawes, tooke away the hearts of many; he ſubſcribed for the Kings power, but ſo as he put him on taking his Subjects goods, and of all other, ſuch wayes be moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; For we know, his Majeſtie is not the laſt that ſuffers, and is not the King worth many thouſands.</p>
            <p>The place of this Judge was to have given and preſerved to the King the hearts of his Subjects, the

               <!-- PDF PAGE 71 -->due execution of the lawes had done this, and when ſuch notice is taken of a Prince, none will conſpire againſt him who cannot faine to themſelves ſafety before or after any fact committed. Forraigne enemies will not invade his Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Thus hath his Majeſtie now got our hearts, and will for ever have them. This Judge is to anſwer for what his Majeſtie, and for what we have ſuffred.</p>
            <p>I am by command of the Houſe of Commons to deſire of your Lordſhips that the proceedings againſt Sir <hi>Robert Berkley</hi> Knight, one of the Juſtices of his Majeſties Court of Kings Bench may be put in as ſpeedy a way of Triall, as the courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will allow.</p>
